This feature ensures secure access to your application and allows you to provide personalized content and functionality for registered users.

- **User-Friendly Data Management:**
  - This application simplifies data management for both administrators and end-users. The "Add Product" and "Update Product" components provide intuitive forms for adding and modifying product details.

These features ensure that product data remains accurate and up-to-date while providing a seamless and efficient data entry process for users.

- **Product Update Form:**
  - The "Update Product" component allows users to modify existing product details in your application. It retrieves the current product data and populates the form fields with the original information, making it easy for users to edit specific attributes such as name, brand name, type, price, rating, short description, and image URL. After making the necessary changes, users can submit the updated information. This feature ensures that product data remains accurate and up-to-date, improving the overall quality of your product listings. Once the update is successful, a confirmation message is displayed using the Swal (SweetAlert2) library, enhancing the user experience. This feature streamlines the process of maintaining an accurate product database, benefiting both administrators and end-users.

- **Shopping Cart Display:**
  - The "Cart" component provides users with a clear and organized view of the products they have added to their cart. It retrieves the cart items from the server and displays them in a tabular format, including product names, prices, and an option to proceed with the purchase. This feature helps users easily review the items in their cart and make informed decisions before proceeding with their purchase.

- **User-Friendly Error Handling:**
  - The "ErrorPage" component offers a user-friendly approach to handling data not found errors. When users encounter such errors, they are presented with a clear and visually appealing message ("Data not found") and a convenient "Go Home" button. This feature ensures that users can easily navigate back to the home page, enhancing their overall experience by providing helpful guidance when encountering unexpected errors.
